Objects: Strokes, MeasureSeparators, GroupSeparators, Repeats

Measure Separator Constraints
- Must be preceeded by Repeat or Stroke

Repeat Constraints
- Must be enclosed in measure separators
- numMeasures must be less than or equal the number of measures 
since the previous repeat or exercise beginning, which ever comes first.

GroupSeparators
- must be preceded by a Stroke
- must be succeede by a Stroke (or end of exercise while editing)

Strokes
- no constraints

Must haves:
- Different sound on first beat of measure
- At beginning of measure could have |5   to denote that there are 5 beats in measure
- Design image that looks like traditional 1/8th note rest and use instead of hyphen

Nice to have:
- quiet counts (just add to settings)
- timing meter
- 

Yet to implement:
- Get metronome working again
- Make decision about ordering within exercise sets
- Email verification
- Logout
- Exercise set configuration for new user. Different for unpaid & paid users. Maybe just start
everyone  with Basic 1 and Tutorial then refer to library. Tutorial should be initial selected exercise set.
- Library of exercise sets page
- Key for all editing buttons
- Hover balloons

Exercise sets to create (all free and show capabilities):
- Ride patterns
- Polyrhythms
- Synchopation
- Accents
- Tutorial (use all notations, polyrhythm, mixed time-signatures).
